TODO:

## Low Priority:
- [ ] follow https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5654 (next systemd release?) (need to make a PR upstream)
- [ ] fix algorithm to set screen brightness based on ambient brightness (needs real world testing)
- [ ] add an initial setup to ask user to eg: set desired screen backlight level matching current ambient brightness
- [ ] update global README with Debian folder/packages
- [x] add a global version flag
- [ ] split into 2 github modules?
