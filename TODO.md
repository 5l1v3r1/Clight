## 1.5
- [x] location_callback for weather module
- [x] each location_callback should check if distance is > N meters/kilometers to avoid useless calls.
- [x] Location module should expose a get_distance(old pos, new pos) function
- [x] add a data struct location { double lat, double lon } and use that everywhere
- [x] Check latitude/longitude values after loading them from opts/config
- [x] update to new 1.6 clightd interface
- [x] drop isinterface_enabled calls
- [x] fix dimmer with set_backlight_level with percentage
- [x] EXIT_FAILURE even when state.quit > ERR_QUIT (should never happen)
- [x] location callback should check if new position is at least LOC_DISTANCE_THRS distant from last pos
- [ ] check for needed clightd version in bus.c
- [ ] make clight work on desktop pc with webcam too (obviously through ddcutil)?
- [ ] TEST && NEW RELEASE!
