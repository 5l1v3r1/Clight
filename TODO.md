- [ ] add weather support -> New struct for timeouts wuld be something like conf.timeout[enum state][enum weather] where enum weather = { UNWKNOWN, SUNNY, RAINY, CLOUDY } and defaults to 0 obviously -> state.weather = 0; ...or just use something like conf.temp[state.time] that cuts up to 50% at 100% cloudiness (mid)
