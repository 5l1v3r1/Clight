### 3.2
- [ ] Port to libmodule

### 3.3
- [ ] Add support for config files to give each monitor its own backlight curves. Something like /etc/clight/clight.conf + /etc/clight/mon.d/$MONITOR_SERIAL.conf (where MONITOR_SERIAL can be found through org.clightd.clightd.Backlight.GetAll)
- [ ] If any conf file is found in /etc/clight/mon.d/, avoid calling SetAll, and just call Set on each serial.
