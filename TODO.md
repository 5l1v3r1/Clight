### 3.1
- [ ] NoAutoCalib to only stop BACKLIGHT module
- [ ] It can be enabled/disabled at runtime
- [ ] expose it through desktop file

### 3.2
- [ ] Add support for config files to give each monitor its own backlight curves. Something like /etc/clight/clight.conf + /etc/clight/mon.d/$MONITOR_SERIAL.conf (where MONITOR_SERIAL can be found through org.clightd.clightd.Backlight.GetAll)
- [ ] If any conf file is found in /etc/clight/mon.d/, avoid calling SetAll, and just call Set on each serial.

## Ideas
- [ ] Write a plasma5-applet? Eg: start from plasma-redshift applet
- [ ] Use the Time PropertiesChanged signal to change KDE/GNOME theme at sunset/sunrise
